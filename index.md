# üå≥ Ways of Listening to Forests

How can we sense and make sense of forests with devices, techniques and our bodies? How might we cultivate an interdisciplinary [‚Äúarts of noticing‚Äù (Tsing)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691178325/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world) for attending to forests and their role in critical zones?

Engaging with themes in the [Critical Zones exhibition and catalogue](https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2020/05/critical-zones), this project explores different ways of listening to forests, drawing on different traditions, techniques, methods, media and approaches ‚Äì from ‚ÄúShinrin Yoku‚Äù (forest bathing) to sensing devices, data sonification to sound walks and storytelling.

The project includes a [public workshop with ZKM as part of the Critical Zones exhibition](https://zkm.de/en/guidedtour-workshop/2021/06/total-gaia-digital-0) to explore and compare different approaches and the possibilities and limits of forest experiences under current sensing conditions between immediacy and mediation.

For more on the use of digital data and devices to cultivate sensibilities towards trees and forests, see the Critical Zones [field book](https://zkm.de/media/file/en/cz_fieldbook_digital_en.pdf) and [catalogue](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-zones), including this chapter on [‚ÄúThe Datafication of Forests‚Äù](https://jonathangray.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gray_DataficationTrees.pdf).
