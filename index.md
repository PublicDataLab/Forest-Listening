# üå≥ Ways of Listening to Forests

How can we sense and make sense of forests with devices, techniques and our bodies? How might we cultivate an interdisciplinary [‚Äúarts of noticing‚Äù (Tsing)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691178325/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world) for attending to forests and their role in critical zones?

Engaging with themes in the [Critical Zones exhibition and catalogue](https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2020/05/critical-zones) curated by [Bruno Latour](http://www.bruno-latour.fr/) and [Peter Weibel](https://zkm.de/en/person/peter-weibel), this project explores different ways of listening to forests, drawing on different traditions, techniques, methods, media and approaches ‚Äì from ‚ÄúShinrin Yoku‚Äù (forest bathing) to sensing devices, data sonification to sound walks and storytelling.

The project includes a [public workshop with ZKM as part of the Critical Zones exhibition](https://zkm.de/en/guidedtour-workshop/2021/06/total-gaia-digital-0) to explore and compare different approaches and the possibilities and limits of forest experiences under current sensing conditions between immediacy and mediation.

For more on the use of digital data and devices to cultivate sensibilities towards trees and forests, see the Critical Zones [field book](https://zkm.de/media/file/en/cz_fieldbook_digital_en.pdf) and [catalogue](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-zones), including this chapter on [‚ÄúThe Datafication of Forests‚Äù](https://jonathangray.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gray_DataficationTrees.pdf).

## üéß  Four Modes of Forest Listening

‚ö†Ô∏è  *The following audio sequences are part of a prototype for testing and feedback that will be further refined, developed and produced after the workshop with ZKM.*

We have curated a series of audio sequences exploring four different modes:
- forest bathing
- field recording
- sonification
- storytelling

Each sequence contains a brief introduction followed by several exercises, practices or projects for you to explore.

These are intended to be listened to in a forest, park or garden, and can be done individually or in a group. Our aim was to produce an audio piece which could be either undertaken in one listening session (of around 90-120 minutes) or in a series of separate listening sessions.

- [Download zip file of all sequences](https://we.tl/t-kQWBNmSrx1)
- [Playlist on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/publicdatalab/sets/listening-to-forests/s-UnV2Cdfdsee)

These four sequences are intended as an entry-point to begin exploring forest listening. They are intended to be illustrative, not comprehensive. We're keen to include other kinds of projects and practices in future phases of the project beyond these approaches (and if you have suggestions they'd be [very welcome](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHUf2ixFpMu4PcGP0UgLsB3zYZd1AuMlYXcQRo9YYIZZWrNg/viewform?usp=sf_link)).

### üì¶ What are the four sequences?

- The first sequence explores **forest bathing** and contains a series of exercises gathered from guides, books and workshops.
- The second sequence explores **field recording** and contains works from [Liz K. Miller](https://www.lizkmiller.com/) and [Andr√©s Saenz de Sicilia](https://villalontanarecords1.bandcamp.com/album/21-9-18).
- The third sequence explores **sonification** and contains works from [Marcus Maeder](https://marcusmaeder.ch/), [Kate Donovan](https://mattersoftransmission.wordpress.com/), [Martin Howse](http://www.1010.co.uk/org/), [Lauren Oakes](https://leoakes.com/) and [Nik Sawe](http://www.niksawe.com/).
- The fourth sequence explores **storytelling** and contains works from [Richard Powers](http://www.richardpowers.net/), [Anagram](https://weareanagram.co.uk/project/messages-to-a-post-human-earth), the [Visual Methodologies Collective](https://visualmethodologies.org/) and [Brian Harnetty](http://www.brianharnetty.com/).

### ‚ùì How can I provide thoughts, feedback or suggestions?

We're very interested in hearing about your experiences of forest listening, these sequences and how we might further develop and improve the project.

On thinking along with these modes of forest listening you may consider:
- What does it mean to listen to forests?
- What is forest listening according to these projects and practices?
- How do different practices guide and shape your attention to trees and forests in different ways?
- What do you notice?
- What is missing or absent?
- What new or unfamiliar perspectives do they bring?
- What can you learn from comparing or combining them?
- How and to what ends might these listening practices be re-specified, modified and re-assembled?

On the project, we‚Äôre interested in feedback on things like:
- How did you find the sound segments?
- What other projects or practices we could add (whether to audio sequences or to the forest listening index below)?
- Would you consider doing this again? Would you be willing to explore and try out future things from this project?

You can [share your thoughts with this form](https://forms.gle/vj8pCKUGnNLqmD1s8) or [send us an email](mailto:forestlistening@publicdatalab.org) (and suggest new projects to add [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHUf2ixFpMu4PcGP0UgLsB3zYZd1AuMlYXcQRo9YYIZZWrNg/viewform?usp=sf_link)).

### üì≤ How can I get them onto my device?

For outdoor listening excursions you may wish to load the audio sequences onto your phone or other device (e.g. MP3 player).
