# üå≥ Ways of Listening to Forests

How can we sense and make sense of forests with devices, techniques and our bodies? How might we cultivate an interdisciplinary [‚Äúarts of noticing‚Äù (Tsing)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691178325/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world) for attending to forests and their role in critical zones?

Engaging with themes in the [Critical Zones exhibition and catalogue](https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2020/05/critical-zones), this project explores different ways of listening to forests, drawing on different traditions, techniques, methods, media and approaches ‚Äì from ‚ÄúShinrin Yoku‚Äù (forest bathing) to sensing devices, data sonification to sound walks and storytelling.

The project includes a [public workshop with ZKM as part of the Critical Zones exhibition](https://zkm.de/en/guidedtour-workshop/2021/06/total-gaia-digital-0) to explore and compare different approaches and the possibilities and limits of forest experiences under current sensing conditions between immediacy and mediation.

For more on the use of digital data and devices to cultivate sensibilities towards trees and forests, see the Critical Zones [field book](https://zkm.de/media/file/en/cz_fieldbook_digital_en.pdf) and [catalogue](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-zones), including this chapter on [‚ÄúThe Datafication of Forests‚Äù](https://jonathangray.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gray_DataficationTrees.pdf).

## üéß  Four Modes of Forest Listening

We have curated a series of audio sequences exploring four different modes: forest bathing, field recording, sonification and storytelling.

Each sequence contains a brief introduction followed by several exercises, practices or projects for you to explore.

These are intended to be listened to in a forest, park or garden, and can be done individually or in a group. Our aim was to produce an audio piece which could be either undertaken in one listening session (of around 90 minutes) or in a series of separate listening sessions.

‚ö†Ô∏è  *The following audio sequences are part of a prototype for testing and feedback that will be further refined, developed and produced after the workshop with ZKM.*

Overview of the four sequences:
- The first sequence explores **forest bathing** and contains a series of exercises gathered from guides, books and workshops.
- The second sequence explores **field recording** and contains works from [Liz K. Miller](https://www.lizkmiller.com/) and [Andr√©s Saenz de Sicilia](https://villalontanarecords1.bandcamp.com/album/21-9-18).
- The third sequence explores **sonification** and contains works from [Marcus Maeder](https://marcusmaeder.ch/), [Kate Donovan](https://mattersoftransmission.wordpress.com/), [Martin Howse](http://www.1010.co.uk/org/), [Lauren Oakes](https://leoakes.com/) and [Nik Sawe](http://www.niksawe.com/).
- The fourth sequence explores **storytelling** and contains works from [Richard Powers](http://www.richardpowers.net/), [Anagram](https://weareanagram.co.uk/project/messages-to-a-post-human-earth), the [Visual Methodologies Collective](https://visualmethodologies.org/) and [Brian Harnetty](http://www.brianharnetty.com/).

This project was initiated by [Jonathan Gray](http://jonathangray.org/) and [Birgit Schneider](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/medienoekologie/index/people) with the [Public Data Lab](http://publicdatalab.org/) to coincide with a [workshop](https://zkm.de/en/guidedtour-workshop/2021/06/total-gaia-digital-0) at the [Critical Zones exhibition at ZKM, Karlsruhe](https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2020/05/critical-zones). The audio sequences are narrated by [Renee-Marie Pizzardi](https://publicdatalab.org/people/renee-marie-pizzardi/). The forest listening sequences and the index were developed with input and contributions from [Andr√©s Saenz de Sicilia](https://villalontanarecords1.bandcamp.com/album/21-9-18), [Brian Harnetty](http://www.brianharnetty.com/), [Brian House](https://brianhouse.net/), [Carlo De Gaetano](https://www.carlodegaetano.com/), [Ginevra Terenghi](https://twitter.com/ginevraterenghi), [Kate Donovan](https://mattersoftransmission.wordpress.com/), [Lauren Oakes](https://leoakes.com/), [Liliana Bounegru](http://lilianabounegru.org), [Liz K.
